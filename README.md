# yap_website

Yet another personal website for me to fiddle with different things.

This is a revision of my typical personal website project that displays
data about me from around the web. With this version I combined the frontend
and backend into a single application instead of hosting them separately.

### getting started

The following instructions are for a Mac.

Requires [python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/):
`brew install python`

Then,

```shell
$ make dev
```

### prior art

See [my-api](https://github.com/chadxz/my-api) and
[personal-site-angular](https://github.com/chadxz/personal-site-angular).
